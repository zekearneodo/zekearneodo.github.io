I'm a Physicist, experimental and computational neuroscientist and an engineer. 
I worked on the design and construction of experiments and mathematical models to understand how we encode stimuli in the brain (chemical senses), and how populations of neurons learn to control the biomechanical machinery that produces vocal behavior.

This blog is about my work in academia, other work that I find interesting, and the occasional rant.

I am currently working at apple, decoding user intention from large arrays of sensors.
I can't tell you exactly how, tho. I mean, I could tell you, but then...
